# SPI-Communication-Arduino-Receiver-and-STM32-Transmitter-for-String-Display
This project demonstrates bidirectional communication between an Arduino UNO and an STM32F4xx microcontroller using the SPI protocol. The STM32F4xx sends a string message, which the Arduino UNO receives and displays on the serial monitor.
